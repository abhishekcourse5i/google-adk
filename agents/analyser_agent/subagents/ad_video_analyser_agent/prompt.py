VIDEO_GUIDELINES = """
o Ensure no overly technical or medical jargon is used that could confuse viewers.

o Verify that the language aligns with common understanding, avoiding complex terms without explanation.

o Check that the volume is consistent and not drowned out by background elements.

o Ensure the speaker articulates clearly, with pacing that allows for easy comprehension, typically not faster than the rest of the ad.

o Verify that the text matches the audio, either by including key phrases or the full transcript.

o Ensure the text is visible for long enough (e.g., not flashing briefly), considering the average ad length of 30-60 seconds (see Response 19, Footnote 7: DTC Ad Length Study).

o Ensure the text is placed in a prominent, unobstructed area of the screen, not overlapping with other visuals.

o Verify sufficient contrast (e.g., white text on dark background or vice versa) for visibility.

o Check that font size is large enough (typically at least 12-point for standard viewing distances) and style is legible (e.g., sans-serif fonts like Arial or Helvetica).

o Ensure no background music or sounds overlap with the major statement that could mask the audio.

o Verify no rapid scene changes or animations occur during the statement.

o Check that other text or graphics do not compete for attention, ensuring the major statement remains the focus.

o Ensure the presentation is engaging but does not downplay the importance of the major statement.

o Verify the ad conveys a truthful, non-misleading net impression, balancing benefits and risks.
